This is the REST Service which takes a mathematical expression and returns value for valid expressions,
 otherwise returns zero. Apart from evaluating expression it also provides information about frequency
 of characters and operators used by a user.There is another service which returns operator most 
 used by a user.

 1.localhost:10090/expression which is a POST url, taking JSON of the form 
 MathExpression = {id: id, exp: expression to be evaluated}. the first property id of object is not 
 obligatory while posting,but an mathematical expression in string form as value with "exp" as key is. 
 this post url will return the value of expression if it is a valid mathmatical expression otherwise 0.
 
 2. localhost:10090/expression/all is a get url, that does not take any request parameters, and returns a 
 list of expressions entered by a user. The list shown will contain only those expression, which was
  entered after most recent launch of application. The list will contain both type of expressions ( valid
